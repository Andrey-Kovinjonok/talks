Functional Parsing in C++20
---------------------------

A talk for Sweden C++ Stockholm 0x1F, held at Atlas Copco Tools on February 24, 2022

Includes wirth-parser, a parser generator, tested on x86-64 with GCC 10.3, Clang 11.0, and MSVC22.17. Released under The Unlicense.

Is C++20 a language that supports a functional style of programming?
Can we write modern C++ code in a pure functional style that would easily translate into a pure functional language like Haskell, and could that C++ code end up looking just as nice while still being reasonably efficient?
In this talk we will take a practical approach and apply ideas from functional programming to a common and non-trivial problem - parsing strings - and develop a small pure functional parsing library from the ground up. On the way we will encounter many nice features from C++20 that, while optional, make this task a lot easier and results in code that can compete with functional languages for clarity and expressiveness.
This talk does not assume theoretical knowledge of functional programming concepts or practical experience with a functional language. You also don't need to know how to write parsers or have many hours of C++20 under your belt.

Ancient Math / Modern C++
-------------------------

A talk for Sweden C++ Stockholm 0x17, held at Berotec on June 13, 2019

Includes math.cpp, a demonstration of the presented concepts, tested on x86-64 with GCC 8.3, Clang 8.0, and MSVC19.20. Released under The Unlicense.

What math should you know to become a better C++ programmer, and how can you use C++ to become better at math?
Let’s revisit some basic facts about numbers known since antiquity and taught to us in school a long time ago, but from a modern C++ programmer’s perspective!

From type to concept

Concepts is the first new major language feature to make it into the draft C++20 standard. With concepts generic programming becomes easier, safer and alot more fun. In this talk we will discover what concepts are and why they are useful. We will also implement a concept that is fundamental to understanding C++ programs, and you will discover that concepts were there in your code all along, whether you knew about them or not.
