Ancient Math / Modern C++
-------------------------

A talk for Sweden C++ Stockholm 0x17, held at Berotec on June 13, 2019

Includes math.cpp, a demonstration of the presented concepts, tested on x86-64 with GCC 8.3, Clang 8.0, and MSVC19.20. Released under The Unlicense.

This version by GitHub user N00byEdge demonstrates that the functions half and is_odd can be implemented on "Paleolithic" natural numbers essentially without knowing how to do arithmetic. (See the first two videos at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A714C94D40392AB for a practical demonstration of the kind of process a person could perform by hand to evaluate these functions.)
